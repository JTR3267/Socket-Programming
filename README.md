# Socket-Programming

This is a simple mail server that uses Python's socket function to implement TCP transmission, and tkinter package to create a basic GUI for the client side. The server part is implemented with multithreading to provide concurrent usage for multiple users, and it provides basic functions such as account registration, sending and receiving emails, viewing, and deleting.

## Run it:

First, run server.py, the IP address and port number will be displayed in the output field. Then change address and port number in client.py to connect to the mail server before running client.py. As long as server.py continues to run, users can log in and check their emails from any computer without worrying about losing their user data.
